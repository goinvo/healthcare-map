    <h1>US Healthcare System Map</h1>

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>There is no single view (diagram or schema) of the US healthcare system that describes the main actors and organizations, proces flows between those entities (care, decisions, rules, financial/funding), legal connections, or health access and outcomes impacts.</p>

    <h2>What we're doing</h2>
    <p>We're in the process of outlining, designing, and building an open source map of the US healthcare system.</p>

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>We hope to not just shine a light on the structure of the US healthcare system, but as an open source tool, it can become a resource for academics, healthcare analysts, health IT engineers and designers, entrepreneurs finding their place in the system, and most of all for healthcare governance and policymakers</p>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <p>Coming soon...</p>

    <h2>Previous Examples</h2>
    <p>Coming soon...</p>
