    <h1>US Healthcare System Map</h1>
    <p>An opensource work in progress by

    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>There is no single diagram or map of the US healthcare system that effectively describes the main actors and relationships between actors.
    The US healthcare system is complex, and many (healthcare policy makers, patients, medical students, etc) would benefit from a System Map.
    Unfortunately, current healthcare system maps are too narrowly focused and/or struggle to clarify the complexity of the system (see examples below).</p>

    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    <p>Our goal at GoInvo is to create and open source map of the US healthcare system. Currently, we are in the process of outlining and designing the map. Ultimately, we hope to build an interactive, mobile-friendly map.</p>

    <h2>Impact</h2>
    <p>We hope to not only shine a light on the structure of the US healthcare system but to create an opensource resource for academics, healthcare analysts, health IT engineers and designers, entrepreneurs finding their place in the system, healthcare governance and policymakers, patients, and more.</p>

    <h2>Initial Concepts</h2>
    <p>We began by mapping out governance bodies.</p>
    <div class="sketch-row">
      <img src="./images/governance_map.png"/>
    </div>
    <p>This kind of hierarchical diagram became lengthy very quickly, so we started to explore a layout and map that could reflect various key roles in the Healthcare System (Research, Pharma, Care, Payment).</p>

    </div>
    <div class="sketch-row">
      <img src="./images/hc_sys_map_dan2.png"/>
    </div>
    <p>This led us to an entity relationship model </p>
    <div class="sketch-row">
      <img src="./images/entity_relationship_model.png"/>
    </div>
    <p>Going through this process, we realized that "Entities" (like CVS) hardly ever stick to consistent "Roles" (such as filling prescriptions). Even in that example, CVS expands their role to Pharmacy benefit
      Manager and even some primary care delivery. Trying to create a map that shows how all of these Roles fit together is nearly impossible because each Entity often expands their roles in different ways. Healthcare
      isn't clear cut. One way to handle this complexity is to map out general roles and then place entities on top of that map. See the examples below.
